# University Students' Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the mental health of students at a Japanese international university. The data was collected through a survey conducted in 2018, with findings published in 2019. 
The study highlights the mental health challenges faced by international students, particularly in relation to depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress. 
The objective of this analysis is to explore how various factors, such as the length of stay, impact students' mental health diagnostic scores.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 286 rows, with each row representing an individual student.

## Analysis Task
The main analysis task is to examine how the length of stay (stay) affects the average mental health diagnostic scores of international students. The specific metrics considered include:

- Depression Score (todep): Measured by the PHQ-9 test.
- Social Connectedness Score (tosc): Measured by the SCS test.
- Acculturative Stress Score (toas): Measured by the ASISS test.
  
SQL code was used to calculate the average scores for each length of stay among international students, providing insights into how these scores vary with time spent at the university.

## Machine Learning Opportunities
One potential extension of this analysis involves building a predictive model to assess the likelihood of high-risk mental health outcomes, such as suicide risk. This analysis could involve supervised learning techniques, using various features like depression scores, social connectedness, acculturative stress, and length of stay as predictors.
